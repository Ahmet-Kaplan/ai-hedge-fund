# Scheduled Runner (GitHub Actions + Telegram) — Design

Date: 2026-10-05 · Status: approved in brainstorming, pending spec review

## Goal

Run the daily routine (paper fund, optionally the live account) without the
user's laptop, on a free schedule, and send the result to the user's phone.
Switching between paper, live dry-run and live must take seconds and must
never be able to trade real money by accident.

## Decisions (from brainstorming)

| Decision | Choice |
|---|---|
| Platform | GitHub Actions scheduled workflow. Not Cloudflare Workers/Workflows: Python + pandas/langchain + a 224 MB SQLite DB + a file ledger don't fit Workers' runtime or free CPU limits; Cloudflare Containers are paid |
| Where it runs | A new **private** repo (e.g. `ai-hedge-fund-runner`). The user's repo is a public fork and can't be made private; state (account values, positions) must not be public |
| Code | Pulled from the public fork at a configurable ref on every run; the private repo holds only the workflow and state |
| Notifications | Telegram bot (free, one HTTPS request per message) |
| Switching | Repo variable `RUN_MODE`: `off` · `paper` · `paper+live-dry` · `paper+live` |
| Time | 08:00 UTC, Monday–Friday (US pre-market: 03:00–04:00 New York); manual "Run workflow" button too |

Timing rationale: the run must (1) start after the previous US close is
final and (2) finish reconciling before the 09:30 New York open, after which
the day's fills change the book. 08:00 UTC sits inside that window all year
with ~5½ hours of buffer for GitHub's best-effort cron delays and a re-run;
pre-market orders fill at the opening auction. Running in US market hours
would make reconcile refuse and fill orders at random intraday prices.

## 1. `aihf-daily` (in this repo)

`hedge_fund/ops/daily.py`, entry point `aihf-daily`:

```
aihf-daily [--mode off|paper|paper+live-dry|paper+live] [--notify]
```

- `--mode` defaults to the `RUN_MODE` environment variable, else `paper`.
- Steps per mode, run in-process by calling the existing CLIs' `main()` with
  stdout captured:

| Mode | Steps |
|---|---|
| `off` | none ("paused") |
| `paper` | `aihf-paper reconcile`, `aihf-paper submit` |
| `paper+live-dry` | paper steps, then `aihf-live run --dry-run` |
| `paper+live` | paper steps, then `aihf-live run` |

- Every step runs even if an earlier one failed (a failed reconcile must not
  stop a Monday rebalance; the existing commands already guard themselves).
- Builds a summary: one header line (`✅`/`❌`, weekday + date, mode), then
  each step's name, exit status and its printed output trimmed to the last
  ~8 lines, total ≤ 3,500 characters (Telegram's limit is 4,096). A run URL
  (`GITHUB_SERVER_URL/GITHUB_REPOSITORY/actions/runs/GITHUB_RUN_ID`, when set)
  is appended.
- `--notify` sends the summary via Telegram; the summary is always printed.
- Exit code 1 if any step failed (so the Actions run shows red), after the
  notification is sent.

Live safety is unchanged and layered: `paper+live` only *invokes*
`aihf-live run`, which still refuses without live keys, `confirm_live: true`
and a completed dry run.

## 2. Telegram (`hedge_fund/ops/telegram.py`)

`send(text, *, token=None, chat_id=None, session=None) -> bool` posts to
`https://api.telegram.org/bot<token>/sendMessage`. Credentials from
`TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` / `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`. Missing credentials → returns
False and prints a hint (never fails the run). Errors never include the
token: the request URL is redacted from any exception text before logging.

## 3. Workflow (`deploy/github-actions/daily.yml`, copied into the runner repo)

- Triggers: `schedule: cron "0 8 * * 1-5"` and `workflow_dispatch` with inputs
  `mode` (choice, default from `RUN_MODE`) and `dry_run_live` (bool).
- `concurrency: hedge-fund-daily` (no overlapping runs, none cancelled).
- Steps:
  1. Checkout code: repo `vars.CODE_REPO` (default
     `viveksingh101994/ai-hedge-fund`) at `vars.CODE_REF` into `code/`.
  2. Checkout this private repo's `state` branch into `state/`; symlink
     `$HOME/.hedge-fund → state/` (the code reads `~/.hedge-fund`).
  3. Restore the market DB with `actions/cache` (key `market-db-<run id>`,
     restore prefix `market-db-`) into `state/market.db`; on a cold cache the
     free data layer re-downloads what it needs.
  4. Python 3.12 + `uv pip install -e code/`.
  5. `aihf-daily --notify` with secrets as env: `APCA_API_KEY_ID`,
     `APCA_API_SECRET_KEY`, `SEC_USER_AGENT`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`,
     `ALPACA_LIVE_KEY_ID`, `ALPACA_LIVE_SECRET_KEY` (optional),
     `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`; `RUN_MODE` from the input or
     `vars.RUN_MODE`.
  6. Always: save the market DB cache; commit and push `state/` (market.db
     excluded by the state branch's `.gitignore`) as
     `state: <date> <mode>`.
- `state` branch contents: `paper/`, `live/`, `live.yaml`, `cache/llm/`,
  `crypto/`, `KILL` (optional). The user edits `live.yaml` or adds `KILL` in
  the GitHub web editor.

## 4. Setup (user-side, documented in `deploy/README.md`)

1. Create the Telegram bot (@BotFather) and get the chat ID.
2. Create the private repo (Claude may create it with `gh` on approval) with
   the workflow and an initial `state` branch seeded from the current
   `~/.hedge-fund` (ledgers, LLM cache, crypto; no market.db, no `.env`).
3. The user adds secrets in the repo settings (never via Claude) and sets
   `RUN_MODE=paper`, `CODE_REF`.
4. Run once with the "Run workflow" button; confirm the Telegram message.
5. Uninstall the Mac schedule if installed, so runs don't double up
   (the duplicate-order guard would make the second a no-op anyway).

## 5. Costs

Actions: ~3–10 min per run × ~22 runs/month ≈ 100–300 min of the 2,000 free
private-repo minutes. Telegram: free. Anthropic: unchanged (the LLM cache
travels in the state branch).

## 6. Error handling

| Failure | Behavior |
|---|---|
| A step raises / exits non-zero | Others still run; ❌ summary names it; job red |
| Telegram unreachable or not configured | Summary printed to the log; job result unchanged |
| State push conflict (manual edit during a run) | `git pull --rebase` then push; if still failing, job red and the summary says state wasn't saved |
| Cold market-DB cache | Slower run while free data re-downloads |
| Cron starts late | Harmless up to ~5 hours (pre-open window) |

## 7. Testing

`aihf-daily`: mode → steps mapping; every step runs after a failure; summary
trimming and length cap; exit code; run-URL line; `--notify` calls the
sender. Telegram: request shape, missing credentials, token redaction in
errors. Fakes only; no network. The workflow YAML is validated by a test that
loads it and checks triggers, cron, concurrency, the `aihf-daily` step and
the always-run state commit.

## 8. Out of scope

Telegram commands (two-way control), Cloudflare, an always-on VM, web
dashboards.
